Hi! I'm Jiayi, a 2026 Yellow Jacket majoring in CS. I wrote this blog in Yokohama, Japan in the middle of my exchange from GT to Tokyo Tech. 

While I greatly enjoy my life here, there are things I wish I had notice before coming. With this in mind, I spent a few days reflecting my exchange life so far, and hereâ€™s a checklist I wish someone had handed me before I submitted my application.

## Academic Things to Doubleâ€‘Check

### Course Transfers
- **Check previous transfers** â€“ review the official [Transfer Equivalency Table](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) to see past approvals.
- **Confirm course availability** at your target schoolâ€”notice that course offerings change each semester. However, you can get an idea of how the courses usually change by referring to schedules of the previous few semesters.
- **If options look thin,** skim [your departmentâ€™s policy](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/exchange-credit-transfer-instructions) and get everything preâ€‘cleared. (The College of Computing, for instance, likes to reâ€‘approve each course every term.)

### If youâ€™re on an Fâ€‘1 visa
- Stay enrolled in **12 GT credits** each semester (some scholarships / financial aid require that too!).
- Silver lining: youâ€™ll be billed **inâ€‘state tuition** even while youâ€™re abroad. ðŸŽ‰



## Life & Housing Checklist

### Your Dorm
- Does your host school offer dorm options? Is it guaranteed? 
  - If not, you might need extra work to learn about local renting rules
- Is your dorm **apartment-style or traditional**?
- Do you have a **private room or shared space**?
- Kitchen, washer/dryer, microwave, etc. ?

### Local Area and Convenience
- Are **supermarkets, restaurants, and malls** easily accessible?
- Do you get to pick your dorm, or is it assigned?
- Timing the **daily commute** now saves headaches later. 

> FYI, my commute time from dorm to main campus for daily lessons takes 80 minutes one-way.

## Tokyo Techâ€‘Specific 

### Credits & Visa

- Tokyo Tech has only a handful of GTâ€‘approved courses, so plan out **12 credits** early.

### Dormitory Assignment
- **Dorms are assigned**, not selectable. Assignments **probably depend** on your labâ€™s campus for YSEP or close to Ookayama for ACAP students.

### Campus Locations and Commuting
- **Ookayama** = central-ish Tokyo (easy trains into the city).
- **Suzukakedai** = technically Yokohama butâ€¦ itâ€™s a hike to Shibuya/Shinjuku. Plot the commute on a map to be sure youâ€™re okay with it.

**Suggested image:** Map showing the distance to central Tokyo (e.g., Shibuya).

### Language Preparation
- Yes, you *can* survive on English, but knowing hiragana, katakana, and a handful of kanji makes daily life so much smootherâ€”think grocery labels and train boards.

> **Suggested image:** A regular station name board at a Japanese train station, noting that while there are English labels, kanji is larger, and English often consists of simple Japanese pronunciations.
